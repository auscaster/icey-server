# Changelog

## 0.2.5 - 2026-10-29

- Update package metadata, release downloads and project links to auscaster.
- Publish APT updates to the transferred auscaster/packages repository and use apt.auscaster.com in generated installation instructions.
- Publish container images to ghcr.io/auscaster/icey-server using the release repository's GitHub identity.

## Unreleased

## 0.2.4 - 2026-10-08

- Pin Icey 2.5.1 to restore builds with FFmpeg 8.
- Use the Icey Server repository, source archive, and package names consistently.
- Publish GitHub download assets independently of Docker Hub credentials, then build the image from the tested release binary and web assets.
- Check public release listings for version drift on a daily schedule.

- Security: `/artifacts/` downloads (recordings, snapshots, motion clips) now require the auth token when one is configured, matching the API and signalling. Plain links may pass the token as a `token` query parameter; the web UI appends it automatically.
- Security hardening recorded from earlier unreleased commits: control-plane protection (auth on `/api/*` except `/api/health`, authenticated WebSocket signalling, status path scrubbing) and CLI port argument validation.
- Port conflicts and invalid listen addresses now fail startup with an actionable error and a non-zero exit, instead of an asynchronous debug-level log followed by a success banner. Both HTTP/WS and TURN ports are probe-checked (TCP and UDP).
- `--log-level <trace|debug|info|warn|error>` and `ICEY_LOG_LEVEL` control console verbosity; the default is now `info` (previously hardwired to `debug`).
- SIGTERM triggers the same graceful shutdown as SIGINT, so `docker stop` and systemd stops no longer kill active sessions, recordings, and TURN allocations uncleanly.
- The binary reads general `ICEY_*` environment variables natively (`ICEY_CONFIG`, `ICEY_HOST`, `ICEY_PORT`, `ICEY_TURN_PORT`, `ICEY_TURN_EXTERNAL_IP`, `ICEY_MODE`, `ICEY_SOURCE`, `ICEY_RECORD_DIR`, `ICEY_WEB_ROOT`, `ICEY_TLS_CERT`, `ICEY_TLS_KEY`, `ICEY_LOOP`, `ICEY_TURN`) with `defaults < config file < env < flags` precedence. The Docker entrypoint now only supplies container defaults.
- An explicitly passed `--config` path that does not exist is an error (exit 3) instead of silently running on built-in defaults.
- Config validation: out-of-range ports are rejected (previously `"port": 70000` silently truncated to 4464), unknown `media.mode` values fail instead of defaulting to `stream`, unknown config keys warn at startup and in `--doctor`, `turn.credentialTtlSeconds` is clamped to 24 hours, and a parse failure no longer leaves a half-populated config behind.
- Flags that need a value report `flag '--host' requires a value` instead of blaming the next argument.
- Distinct exit codes, documented in `--help` and the README: 0 success, 1 runtime, 2 usage, 3 config, 4 preflight.
- The packaged web-root fallback applies whenever `webRoot` was not explicitly set, fixing packaged installs that carry a `config.json` without a `webRoot` key.
- The startup banner prints which config file was loaded (or that defaults are in use) and scrubs `user:pass@` from RTSP source URLs; `--doctor` output scrubs them too.
- Docker: `HEALTHCHECK` wired to `/api/health` in both the Dockerfile and Compose, `.dockerignore` added, `curl` included in the image.
- Example configs now surface `auth.token`, `turn.secret`, and `turn.credentialTtlSeconds`, and align on the `h264` auto-pick codec sentinel.
- Bumped the pinned `icey` dependency from `2.4.9` to `2.5.0`.

## 0.2.3 - 2026-04-28

- Bumped the pinned `icey` dependency from `2.4.8` to `2.4.9` (codec registry now runtime-probes encoders so Linux CI no longer picks `h264_nvenc` on hosts without CUDA).

## 0.2.2 - 2026-04-28

- Bumped the pinned `icey` dependency from `2.4.7` to `2.4.8` (cross-platform CI build fixes for Windows MSVC and Linux without libavdevice).
- `scripts/facetime-demo.sh` rewritten as a single-process bring-up: just `icey-server --source 'avfoundation:0:none'`. mediamtx and the ffmpeg subprocess are gone, along with the orphaned `docs/mediamtx.yml`. Audio is off by default (`AUDIO_DEVICE=none`); set `AUDIO_DEVICE=0` to capture the built-in mic.
- `docs/facetime-on-macbook.md` rewritten for the native single-process path. Drops the mediamtx and ffmpeg-CLI sections, the RTP-over-UDP loss workaround, and the duplicate-frame timestamp workaround. Adds a troubleshooting entry for the AVFoundation freeze that 2.4.7 fixed (`av_read_frame` returning `AVERROR(EAGAIN)`).
- `SKILL.md` updated to describe the single-process M4 path instead of the prior `mediamtx + ffmpeg + icey-server` chain.

## 0.2.1 - 2026-04-28

- `MediaSession` opens local OS cameras directly when `--source` is a libavdevice URL (`avfoundation:0:none`, `v4l2:/dev/video0`, `dshow:video=...`). Removes the `mediamtx + ffmpeg + RTSP` relay from the FaceTime camera demo on macOS; the same dispatch is wired for v4l2 (Linux) and dshow (Windows). Per-source demuxer hints (framerate, video_size) come from the existing `videoFps` / `videoWidth` / `videoHeight` config fields. Network-source RTSP options stay scoped to network sources only.
- `--doctor` and the start-up preflight recognise device URLs and skip the local-file existence check.
- `/api/config` now emits `source.value` / `source.kind` / `source.remote`, matching the existing doctor JSON shape. The web UI sidebar shows the configured source instead of "(no source configured)".
- Bumped the pinned `icey` dependency from `2.4.6` to `2.4.7` (native device input, `avdevice_register_all` init, `MediaCapture::run` no longer treats `AVERROR(EAGAIN)` as fatal).
- Browser smoke (`web/tests/browser-smoke.mjs`) updated for the 0.2.0 UI selectors (`status--online`, `is-hidden`, `codec-value` / `bitrate-value`) and now accepts device-URL sources via `MEDIA_SERVER_SOURCE='avfoundation:0:none'`. Validates the native device input path end-to-end on macOS.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-04-28

- Rebuilt the bundled web UI as a video-first surface. Persistent dismissable side rail with peers, events, and pipeline stats. HUD overlays for glass-to-glass latency, fps, codec, bitrate, voice activity, and motion regions. Idle auto-fade for chrome and cursor. Speaker default-muted to avoid the FaceTime-mic-into-speakers feedback loop on a single-Mac demo
- New `MediaSession` handling for live network sources: detects `rtsp://`, `rtsps://`, `rtmp://`, `rtmps://`, `srt://` prefixes, applies low-latency demuxer hints (`rtsp_transport=tcp`, `fflags=nobuffer`, `flags=low_delay`, `analyzeduration` and `probesize` capped to a single keyframe, no reorder buffer), and disables file-style framerate limiting and looping
- `MediaSession::StateChanged` now wraps source bring-up in a try/catch so RTSP open failures hang up the call and stay alive instead of taking the entire process down
- Browser-captured audio constraints now request WebRTC echo cancellation, noise suppression, and auto gain control
- New `make facetime-demo` (and `scripts/facetime-demo.sh`) brings up mediamtx, ffmpeg (avfoundation), and icey-server together with one `Ctrl-C` tear-down. macOS only
- New `docs/facetime-on-macbook.md` covers the realtime FaceTime camera path, including the libc++ portability fix in `nilstate/icey`, mediamtx TCP-only config, ffmpeg `-use_wallclock_as_timestamps 1` (which is also what makes the in-browser glass-to-glass latency badge work), the audio resampler bring-up, and the source-loss crash guard
- Bumped the pinned `icey` dependency to use the audio encoder resampler fix, the `MediaCapture::setOpenOptions` API, and the libc++ `file_clock::to_sys` portability fix from `nilstate/icey`

## 0.1.3 - 2026-04-14

- Bumped the pinned `icey` dependency release from `2.4.4` to `2.4.5`
- Hardened release packaging so `ICEY_SOURCE_DIR` no longer silently drifts from the pinned `icey` tag when release metadata is available

## 0.1.2 - 2026-04-06

- Hardened `icey-server` as a standalone product repo on top of `icey`
- Added runtime intelligence event plumbing for `vision` and `speech`
- Added browser smoke coverage and release-check scaffolding
- Added operator-facing health and status endpoints
